# Estuary Connectors

This repo hosts development for connectors for use with Flow.

The `source-*` connectors all implement the [flow capture
protocol](https://github.com/estuary/flow/blob/master/go/protocols/capture/capture.proto). Source connectors in this repo can be used with Flow.

The `materialize-*` connectors all implement the [Flow Materialize gRPC protocol](https://github.com/estuary/flow/blob/master/go/protocols/materialize/materialize.proto), and only work with Flow.

All connectors in this repository are dual licensed under MIT or Apache 2.0 at your discretion.
