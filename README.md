 # Estuary Connectors

This repo hosts development of connectors implementing the 
[Airbyte spec](https://docs.airbyte.io/understanding-airbyte/airbyte-specification). Flow uses the 
Airbyte protocol for capturing data from external systems. Connectors in this repo can (at least
theoretically) be used with either Flow or Airbyte, or anything else that uses the Airbyte protocol.

All connectors in this repository are dual licensed under MIT or Apache 2.0 at your discretion.
